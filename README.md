# 🤖 The Sarcastic Overlord (Gemini-Powered)

Congratulations. You’ve found the GitHub repo for a chatbot that’s smarter than you, funnier than you, and definitely more judgmental. Powered by Google’s Gemini API, this bot doesn't just answer questions—it critiques your existence with real-time, streaming responses.

## 💅 Features

- **Gemini Pro Integration:** Using the latest AI models to craft the perfect insults.  
- **Streaming Responses:** Watch the bot roast you word-by-word in real-time. Because waiting for a slow bot is the only thing more pathetic than your search history.  
- **Context Awareness:** It remembers what you said two minutes ago just to throw it back in your face later.  
- **React-Powered:** Built with React, because vanilla JS is for people who still use Internet Explorer.
